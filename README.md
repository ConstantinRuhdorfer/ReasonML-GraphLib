# Welcome

This is a reimplimentation of https://github.com/ConstantinRuhdorfer/GraphLib.

Why?

Because the original version was too slow and I was challanged to make a functional version.
The python version is more easier to understand.
This is mostly an experiment.

## Build

```sh
npm run build
```

## Build + Watch

```sh
npm run start
```
